# fragnova-chain-extension-methods

This repository contains the **definitions of all the chain extension methods of the [Fragnova Blockchain](https://github.com/fragcolor-xyz/fragnova)**. 

Fragnova ink! smart contract developers should integrate these method definitons into the environment of their smart contracts (https://paritytech.github.io/ink/ink/attr.chain_extension.html#example-environment), if they wish to call these methods in their smart contracts.
